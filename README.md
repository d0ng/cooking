# cooking
This repository is an experiment to determine the efficacy of Github issues as a way to store, share, and discuss various recipes that we want to share amongst the psuedo-foodie group that has formed.

## Current workflow
*Please alter this section as you see the process needs changing.*
* Create an issue with the recipe in the repo [issues](https://github.com/d0ng/cooking/issues) section
* Tag recipe with appropriate items (ie salad, italian, chicken)
